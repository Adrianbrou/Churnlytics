# Churnlytics: Summarize & Readme

### (Member Retention & Churn Dashboard)

In this project, I built a **Member Retention and Churn Analysis Dashboard** to help the gym understand **why members cancel and how to reduce churn using data**. I analyzed sign-up dates, cancellation dates, check-in frequency, membership types, personal training purchases, class attendance, demographics, and location data.

First, I used this data to **identify churn patterns**. For example, I found that members with **low weekly check-ins**, **monthly plans**, and **no personal training sessions** were more likely to cancel within the first 2 to 3 months. I also compared both gym locations to detect performance differences.

Next, I **translated insights into real business actions**. Based on the results, the gym implemented targeted retention strategies such as follow-ups for inactive members, free onboarding training sessions, class engagement programs, and incentives to upgrade monthly members to longer-term plans. Location-specific improvements were also prioritized where churn was higher.

Finally, I tracked performance after implementation by monitoring **monthly churn rate, retention rate, average member lifetime, and engagement metrics**. This allowed the gym to measure whether the changes were working and continuously optimize the strategy.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data analytics can move beyond reporting and directly support **business decision-making, revenue growth, and customer retention**.

## Member Retention & Churn Analysis Dashboard

### Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing gym membership data to understand customer retention, churn behavior, and engagement patterns. The goal was to transform raw operational data into actionable business insights that help improve customer loyalty and reduce cancellations.

### Data Used

The dataset includes:

- Member sign-up and cancellation dates
- Membership type (monthly, annual, tier)
- Check-in frequency
- Class attendance records
- Personal training session purchases
- Member demographics
- Gym location data

### Key Objectives

- Identify churn trends and high-risk member segments
- Measure engagement impact on retention
- Compare performance across gym locations
- Support data-driven retention strategies

### Business Insights & Actions

The analysis revealed that members with low attendance, monthly memberships, and no personal training sessions had higher churn rates. Based on these findings, retention strategies such as onboarding programs, engagement campaigns, training session incentives, and location-level improvements were implemented to improve long-term membership value.

### KPIs Tracked

- Monthly churn rate
- Retention rate
- Average membership duration
- Member engagement levels
- Location performance metrics

### Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and analysis
- Business intelligence reporting
- KPI tracking and performance monitoring
- Dashboard visualization and stakeholder communication

### Outcome

This project demonstrates how analytics can directly support business decision-making by connecting data insights to real operational improvements and measurable retention performance.
